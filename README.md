## Introduction
Similar to my suicide analysis project that was done in Tableau (can find that here if interested: https://github.com/mrostar/Suicide-Analysis-Project), this Streamlit app is meant to showcase which specific subgroups (broken down by gender, age, and race/ethnic group) have the highest death rate for suicide in the United States. For this project, I utilized VS Code/Python for the programming aspect of the project, with the finished project being deployed to the link above. 

## Data operation/abstraction design
The data used for this project was downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and contains information on estimated death rates for suicide in the United States, measured as deaths per 100,000 residents. It includes data from 1950 up to 2018 and is broken down by gender, age, and race/ethnic group. With the majority of the estimates being crude, I previously filtered the original dataset and wrote the filtered data to a new CSV. Leveraging Python, I also created a variety of filters on the dataset to get the necessary data needed to make the charts.

 ## Future work
Since this dataset only contains information up to 2018, I would like to gather more recent data to see if there have been any changes in the trends I identified. This would create a more robust analysis and help determine what has changed and why.
